### Module description

**DRY** (Don’t Repeat Yourself), **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), and **YAGNI** (You Aren’t Gonna Need It) are fundamental 
principles in software development, including front-end development. Here's why:

1. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself): This principle is aimed at reducing repetition. Reusing code as much as possible 
helps maintain consistency, minimizes errors, and makes the code easier to manage and maintain. It also saves time since less coding is required.

2. KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid): This principle is a reminder to keep your code simple and straightforward. Simple 
code is easier to read, understand, maintain, and debug. It leads to higher productivity and lessens the likelihood of introducing errors.

3. YAGNI (You Aren’t Gonna Need It): This principle involves only programming functions necessary for the current 
operations and not adding functionality just because it might be needed in the future. This prevents code over-complication and keeps it clean, maintainable and optimized.

A front-end developer who understands and applies these principles will likely write more efficient, effective, 
and maintainable code. This not only benefits the developer himself but also the entire team working on the project.

<br/>

**Clean code** forms a critical basis for every front-end developer for several reasons:

1. **Readability**: Clean code is much easier to read and understand. This becomes crucial when multiple developers work on
a project or when you return to your own code after some time.

2. **Maintenance**: Clean code is more straightforward to update or fix. When your code is clean, it provides a clear overview
of what each part of your code does, making it easier to identify and rectify bugs.

3. **Efficiency**: Clean code helps you and your team work much faster. It reduces complex or unnecessary parts of the code, 
which leads to better overall performance of your application.

4. **Collaboration**: When you are working on a team, clean code helps ensure everyone can understand each other's work. This 
leads to more effective collaboration and communication between team members.

5. **Professionalism**: Writing clean code signals that you respect your craft and take pride in your work. It is a key 
attribute that distinguishes a professional developer from a beginner.

6. **Future-proofing**: Changes, updates, and fixes are a fact of life in software development. Writing clean code makes your 
application more adaptable to future changes and enhancements.

The impact of learning clean coding practices goes beyond improved personal development; it fundamentally enhances the 
quality of the applications you work on and increases the productivity of your team.
