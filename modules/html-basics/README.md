### Module description
This week you will get knowledge about HTML5.
**HTML**, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and 
structure content on the web. It serves as the backbone of any web page, providing structure and layout 
for the content displayed on it.

In **HTML**, elements are represented by tags, such as headings, paragraphs, lists, images, links, and many others.
These tags allow you to organize the content in a hierarchical and semantic manner, making it easier for web 
browsers to interpret and render the content correctly.

When creating a web page, developers write **HTML** code to define the structure, formatting, links, and other 
elements, which are then interpreted by web browsers. The browser takes the **HTML** code and turns it into a 
visually formatted web page that users can view and interact with.

**HTML** is a foundational technology, along with **CSS** (Cascading Style Sheets) and **JavaScript**, that helps 
create modern, interactive, and responsive websites.
