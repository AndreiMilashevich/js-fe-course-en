# Introduction to the Markdown

**Markdown** is a lightweight markup language with simple and intuitive syntax, designed to be easier to
write and read compared to languages like HTML. It was created by _John Gruber_ and Aaron Swartz in _2004_ with the goal 
of allowing people to create formatted text using plain text editors.

In **Markdown**, you can apply formatting, such as headings, bold, italics, links, lists, and more, using just regular
text characters like asterisks, underscores, and brackets. When you write in Markdown, you can easily read and write
the text even without the actual formatting, ensuring the content remains human-readable and easy to maintain.
