### Module description
**CSS Modules** are an essential tool for a front-end developer as they provide several advantages:

1. **Scoped Styles**: With CSS modules, each style is scoped locally by default, which eliminates the risk of global scope and
name clashes. It can be a powerful way to include styles without worrying about interference between components.

2. **Modularity**: CSS modules promote a modular approach to styling, allowing developers to use and manage styles on a 
component-by-component basis. This makes maintaining the codebase easier, especially for large applications.

3. **Easy Migrations**: CSS modules can be incrementally adopted, which makes migrations easier. You can start using them 
in single components, see the benefits, and then gradually roll them out across your project.

4. **Code Reusability**: Component-specific styles encourage code reusability. With CSS modules, you can write a set of 
CSS once and reuse it in different components without clashes.

5. **Compatibility**: CSS modules are supported by many popular JavaScript frameworks and libraries including React, 
Vue and Angular.

6. **Team Collaboration**: They help prevent naming collisions and other tricky bugs that can occur in larger teams or 
codebases.

Learning CSS Modules will give you a different, component-based perspective of working with styles, and can improve 
your front-end code organization, maintainability and reusability.
