### Module description

**JavaScript modules** are a vital aspect of modern JavaScript programming that provide various benefits, making them a 
crucial part of a front-end developer's skill set. Here's why:

1. **Maintainability**: Modules help to organize code by breaking it into manageable chunks, each responsible for a 
specific functionality. From a practical standpoint, this makes the code easier to maintain, debug, and understand.

2. **Namespace pollution**: In JavaScript, variables defined in the global scope can be accessed and modified from 
anywhere in a codebase, leaving the code vulnerable to accidental variable reassignments. Modules provide a scope for the variables, functions, and classes it exports, preventing unintentional modification.

3. **Reusability**: Modules allow you to create a set of functions that perform a specific task and reuse them across 
different parts of an application, or even across different projects.

4. **Dependency Management**: JavaScript modules have a built-in system for dependency management using import and export 
statements. This ensures code separation and order which can be beneficial when the codebase becomes extensive.

5. **Lazy-Loading**: With modules, front-end developers can utilize code splitting and lazy loading. As a result, the initial 
load time of the application can be decreased significantly, as not all scripts need to be loaded at once.

6. **ES6 and beyond**: Modules are part of the ES6 (and subsequent versions) specifications. Understanding and using them is 
part of using modern JavaScript.

In conclusion, leveraging JavaScript modules can lead to cleaner, more efficient, and more manageable code. Hence, a
front-end developer should certainly have sound knowledge of it.
