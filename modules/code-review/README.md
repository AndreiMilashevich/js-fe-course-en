### Module description

**Code review** is a crucial practice for front-end developers for several reasons:

1. **Quality Assurance**: Code review helps to detect bugs, ensure code correctness, and improve the overall quality of
the software. The extra pair of eyes can catch errors, from simple typos to more complex logic issues.

2. **Maintainability**: Reviewers can provide feedback on code readability and maintainability. They can suggest more 
efficient ways to structure, format, or refactor code. This is specifically important for the front-end, where the code
has to be maintained over time and might be handled by different programmers.

3. **Sharing Knowledge**: Code reviews are great opportunities for both the reviewer and the coder to learn from each 
other. For junior developers, it's an excellent opportunity to receive mentorship, and for seniors, it's a chance to share
their knowledge with others and even learn a few tricks themselves.

4. **Consistency**: Regular code reviews help maintain a consistent coding style across the project. This uniformity 
makes the code base easier to read and understand, especially on the front-end where there are often strict style and 
design guidelines to follow.

5. **Foster Teamwork**: Code reviews encourage collaborative work, knowledge sharing, and team building. They create a 
culture of open communication and mutual respect, and make everyone feel responsible for the overall success of the project.

6. **Learn to Provide Constructive Feedback**: When reviewing your peers' codes, one learns how to provide constructive 
and valuable feedback which can be a valuable skill in the professional world.

Thus, code reviews have a significant role in professional growth, learning, and knowledge sharing beyond simply 
improving the code base.
