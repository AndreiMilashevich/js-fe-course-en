### Module description
Understanding **forms and validation** is important for a front-end developer for a number of reasons:

1. **User Input**: Forms are the most common method for collecting user input on the web. Whether it's a login form, 
a contact form, a survey, or any other type of data collection, forms are essential.

2. **Data Quality**: Validation helps ensure the data a user provides is accurate, complete, and secure. This can mean 
checking that email addresses are in the correct format, passwords meet security requirements, required fields are 
not left blank, etc.

3. **User Feedback**: By providing immediate feedback on form input, front-end developers can guide users on how to correctly
complete the form and prevent frustration or confusion.

4. **Security**: Validating user input can prevent attacks or malicious use of your website. For example, input sanitization
can protect against code injection attacks.

5. **Performance**: By validating forms on the client-side before they are submitted, developers can reduce unnecessary server
load and speed up response times, leading to a better user experience.

6. **Legal Compliance**: In certain cases, validating user input can also help websites stay compliant with legal requirements
such as age restrictions or terms agreement.

In essence, forms and validation are core to creating interactive and secure web applications and sites. They help 
protect your site, ensure data integrity, and enhance user experience. Hence, every front-end developer should be 
proficient in them.
