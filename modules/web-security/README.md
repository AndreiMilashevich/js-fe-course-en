### Module description

**Web security** is a critical concept for front-end developers for several reasons:

1. **Protecting User Data**: Front-end developers often handle sensitive user data. Understanding web security can help protect
this data from common security vulnerabilities, such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

2. **Trust and Reliability**: A secure web application fosters user trust. If users don't trust your website because of security
issues, they are less likely to use it.

3. **Compliance**: Many industries require strict compliance with various data protection standards (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA). 
A solid understanding of web security can help ensure that your application meets these needs.

4. **Preventing Data Breaches**: Understanding web security can prevent breaches that could result in financial loss and damage 
to the company's reputation.

5. **Secure Coding Practices**: Knowledge of web security promotes secure coding practices, leading to more robust and secure 
applications.

6. **Better Problem-Solving**: If a security issue arises, a developer with a background in web security will be better 
equipped to handle and resolve the issue quickly.

7. **Job Requirements**: More and more, employers are valuing developers with web security expertise to ensure their 
applications and software are developed with security in mind from the beginning.

In short, every front-end developer should have a fundamental understanding of web security to build reliable, secure, 
and trusted web applications.
