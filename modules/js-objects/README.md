## Module Description
**JavaScript objects** are fundamental for front-end development. Here's why:

1. **Data Representation**: Objects provide a way to group related data and functions together. They help in building 
structured, modular, and maintainable code. For example, you can represent a user as an object with properties 
like name, bio, age, and functions like login, logout.

2. **DOM Manipulation**: In the Document Object Model (DOM), almost everything is an object. So, understanding objects is 
important to manipulate HTML documents.

3. **JSON**: JSON, also an object-based data structure like JavaScript objects, has become a universal standard for data 
exchange in web applications. As a front-end developer, you will very likely interact with APIs, which often return JSON data.

4. **Object-Oriented Programming**: JavaScript is a prototype-based language and uses objects for implementing concepts 
like inheritance and encapsulation in object-oriented programming.

5. **Built-in Objects**: JavaScript provides many built-in objects like Date, Math, String, Array, etc., which a front-end
developer uses frequently.

6. **Libraries/Frameworks**: Understanding objects is crucial while working with JavaScript libraries and frameworks. 
For example, in React.js, component states are often managed using objects.

Understanding how to create, access, and manipulate properties in JavaScript objects as well as mastering methods 
associated with them, allows a front-end developer to write clean, robust, and effective code for building interactive
web applications.
