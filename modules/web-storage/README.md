### Module description

**Web storages** play an important role in enhancing user experience and performance optimization in web applications. 
Here's why front-end developers should learn about them:

1. **Client-Side Storage**: Web storage allows applications to store data on a user's local device. This can significantly 
improve the performance of the web application, as data can be retrieved instantly without making additional network requests.

2. **Session persistence**: With web storage, user-specific details, interface options, and other data can be saved between 
browsing sessions, enhancing the user experience by maintaining the application state or personal settings across site visits and page reloads.

3. **Offline Availability**: Utilizing web storage can enable applications to function even while offline by storing necessary 
data of the user or application on their device.

4. **Reduced Network Traffic**: As data can be stored and retrieved locally from the user's device, utilizing web storage 
can reduce the need for constant server contact, hence minimizing network requests and server load.

5. **Powerful features**: Modern web storage options like IndexedDB and Cache API are incredibly powerful, allowing for 
capabilities like storing complex objects, caching assets, and even storing and retrieving files.

6. **Alternative to Cookies**: Unlike cookies, web storages such as localStorage and sessionStorage do not send stored data
with every HTTP request, reducing traffic between the client and server.

By understanding web storage, front-end developers can effectively manage client-side data storage, leading to the development of faster, more responsive, and user-friendly web applications.
