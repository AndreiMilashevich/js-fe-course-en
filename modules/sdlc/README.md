### Module description
**Scrum and Kanban** are two popular methodologies employed in Agile software development. As a front-end developer, 
understanding Scrum and Kanban can provide several benefits:

1. **Collaboration**: Scrum and Kanban revolve around teamwork and communication. Knowing these methodologies leads to 
better collaboration with other team members, such as back-end developers, designers, product owners, and project managers.

2. **Workflow Understanding**: These methodologies provide a structure for breaking down tasks and managing workflow. 
This understanding can help developers manage their work more effectively, handle roadblocks, and meet deadlines.

3. **Flexibility**: Agile teams often switch between Scrum and Kanban based on the project's needs. Understanding these 
methodologies enables developers to adapt quickly.

4. **Visibility**: Scrum and Kanban methodologies involve visualizing the workflow, which can help identify bottlenecks, 
track progress, and increase overall productivity.

5. **Customer Focus**: Both methodologies encourage regular feedback and iterative work, promoting closer alignment to 
customer needs and quicker incorporation of changes.

In the increasingly Agile world of software development, having Scrum and Kanban knowledge can help a front-end 
developer be more efficient, improve teamwork, and ultimately build better products.
