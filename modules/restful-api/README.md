### Module description

A **RESTful API** (Application Programming Interface) is a set of conventions and practices for how applications should 
communicate with each other. It's essential for a front-end developer to understand RESTful APIs for the following 
reasons:

1. **Data Interaction**: Front-end applications often need to communicate with servers to retrieve, create, update, or delete 
data. RESTful APIs provide a standard, organized way to perform these operations.

2. **Integration**: Many services and platforms (social networks, databases, cloud services etc.) expose their data and 
functionality through RESTful APIs. Understanding these APIs will allow developers to integrate these services into 
their own applications.

3. **Efficiency**: Predefined conventions in RESTful APIs can help simplify and speed up the development process.

4. **Flexibility**: Learning about RESTful APIs gives front-end developers the ability to work with any backend that adheres to
these conventions.

5. **Collaboration**: Understanding RESTful APIs can boost collaboration between front-end developers and back-end developers 
as it establishes a contract for data exchange.

6. **Application Architecture**: A RESTful approach to building APIs encourages stateless server architecture which can improve
scalability and reliability.

7. **Job Market Demands**: Many job postings for front-end developers list "experience with RESTful APIs" as a requirement or 
desired skill, it is a widely used standard in industry.

In conclusion, knowledge of RESTful APIs allows front-end developers to interact with any server in a standardized way, 
fetching and manipulating data as required by the application.
