### Module description

The principles such as **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid), **YAGNI** (You Aren't Gonna Need It), **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself),
and **SOLID** principles are some vital principles that not just front-end developers, but all software developers should be
aware of. They have their own specific advantages:

1. **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid)**: This principle encourages developers to keep their code simple and readable for 
easier maintenance, better performance, and error reduction. Simple code also promotes better collaboration as it's 
easier for others to understand.

2. **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It)**: This principle advises against adding functionality until deemed necessary.
It helps keep the project lean and focused, reduces complexity, and saves development time.

3. **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)**: This principle discourages code duplication. Applying DRY principle makes the code more 
reusable, easier to maintain, and minimizes errors.

4. **SOLID Principles**: This is a set of five principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface 
Segregation, Dependency Inversion) that help in making the software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

By understanding and applying these principles, front-end developers can write clean, long-lasting, and reusable code 
that is easy to maintain and understand.
