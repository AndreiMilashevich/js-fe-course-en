### Module description

This learning module provides an in-depth understanding of generators and iterators in JavaScript. Generators are functions that can be paused and resumed, allowing for the generation of a sequence of values over time. Iterators, on the other hand, are objects that provide a way to access elements sequentially. By mastering generators and iterators, you will gain powerful tools for controlling the flow of execution and working with collections in JavaScript.
