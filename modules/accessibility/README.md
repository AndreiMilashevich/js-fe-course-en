## Module Description

There are several reasons why front-end developers should learn about **accessibility**:

1. **User Experience**: Making your website or application accessible ensures that it can be used by the widest range of
users possible, regardless of individual abilities or disabilities. It significantly contributes to overall user experience.

2. **Legal Compliance**: In many countries, accessibility is a legal requirement. Non-compliance can result in legal 
troubles, including lawsuits and penalties.

3. **Social Responsibility**: It's important to create a web that is accessible to everyone. This includes individuals 
with vision impairments, hearing loss, cognitive disorders, and other disabilities.

4. **SEO Benefits**: Many accessibility practices, such as providing alternative text for images and meaningful link text, 
also improve SEO as they make the site easier for search engine bots to understand.

5. **Market Reach**: An accessible website reaches more people, including the aging population whose physical abilities 
might be changing with age.

6. **Usability**: Improved accessibility often correlates with improved usability because an accessible site tends to be 
cleaner and simpler to navigate for everyone.

7. **Respect for User Diversity**: Designing for accessibility acknowledges and respects the diversity of users, increasing 
the inclusivity of the web.

In essence, accessibility is not optional but an integral part of web development, and front-end developers play
a crucial role in making the web accessible for everyone.
