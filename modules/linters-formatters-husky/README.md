### Module description

**Linters**, **formatters**, and tools like **Husky** are essential for front-end developers for several reasons:

1. **Linters**: A linter is a tool that analyzes source code to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and 
suspicious constructs. This allows developers to catch and fix issues before they become problems. This is especially
important in front-end development as it can prevent potential issues that might affect the user interface or user 
experience.

2. **Formatters**: Code formatters automatically format your code to a certain style guide. This ensures consistency across 
your codebase, making it more readable and maintainable. It also eliminates the need for developers to spend time 
formatting code themselves, allowing them to focus on solving more complex tasks.

3. **Husky**: Husky is a tool used for automating the use of Git hooks. These hooks are scripts that run automatically every
time a particular event occurs in a Git repository. They let you customize Git's internal behavior and trigger 
customizable actions at key points in the development life cycle. For example, you can set up a pre-commit hook to run 
linter and tests before every commit, ensuring that only validated code makes it into the repository.

In conclusion, these tools help in maintaining code quality, consistency, and enforcing rules, which is necessary for 
efficiency, collaboration, and preventing errors in large codebases. They also automate some tasks, which allows 
developers to focus on writing code.
