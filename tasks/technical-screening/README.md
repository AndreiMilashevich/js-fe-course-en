## Interview with a mentor
Technical Screening or The process of recruiting students by a mentor to their group.
## Interview goals:
- Forming a list of students for RSSchool stage#2.
- Forming “Mentor-students” subgroups.

Each mentor interviews more people than he planned to mentor (eg: +2 students).
After all the interviews have been completed, the mentor may drop part of the group in order to keep the number of students that he can mentor. Mentors can postpone the exclusion for several weeks in order to make a more informed decision.

- Checking the level of students' preparation.
- Students get the experience of going through the interview.
- 
## Attention! RS School doesn’t check in advance:
- Mentors’ adequacy.
- Students’ adequacy.

## Interview process
Interviews take place during the last week of the stage#1 and the first week of stage#2.
You can track up-to-date information on the interview in [app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school) in the `Interviews` section. It will contain a link to the interview’s description, the deadline, and a registration button.

### Phases
1. **Registration**. In order to take part in the selection for an interview, the student should press the `Register` button. If the student already has an Interview, there is no need to press the button, you should contact the interviewer.
2. **Pairs formation**. After distribution, students will see “Interviewer” - there will be a link to his account in [app.rs.school](https://app.rs.school) with the contacts for communication. The student needs to contact the interviewer within the first week and agree on the date of the interview.
If a student does not have an Interviewer, he is not invited to an interview and is automatically moved to the wait-list.
3. **Interviewing**. The interview will be conducted online. The average length of an interview is ~60 minutes.
4. **Results of the interview**. After the student has passed the interview, the `Result` column will contain information about the mentor's decision: Yes - the mentor takes the student, otherwise the student is moved to the wait-list.

**Wait-list** - a list of students who were either not invited for an interview or were rejected by the mentor after the interview. Mentors can select students from this list.

**Redistribution**. At the administration’s discretion, a redistribution would take place. Students from the wait-list will participate in it.
