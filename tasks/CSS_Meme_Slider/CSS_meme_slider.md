Mobile:

1. The slider is positioned with equal margins on the left and right;
2. Placement of images, their captions, and controls:

Desktop:

Mobile:

3. There is an animation for changing images when clicking on the controls (for example: flipping, disappearing, scrolling, etc. The main thing is an animated/smooth change)
4. There is an animation for changing image captions when clicking on the controls (for example: flipping, disappearing, scrolling, etc. The main thing is an animated/smooth change)
5. Image captions should be string values (text)
6. Each control has a large clickable area
7. Controls have interactivity (hover effect, click moment, active control, cursor change). The yellow circle in the example above is an indication of a mouse click in the recording program, you don't need to implement or evaluate that.

## Evaluation Criteria
**Maximum score for the task is 150**

1. Everything from the section `Requirements for the repository and how to submit the task:` **+30**
2. The slider is positioned with equal margins on the left and right **+10**
3. The placement of images, their captions, and controls is respected **+10**
4. There is a smooth animation for changing images **+20**
5. There is a smooth animation for changing image captions **+10**
6. Image captions should be string values (text), i.e., the text should not be part of the image **+15**
7. Each control has a larger clickable area than the size of the control itself **+5**
8. Controls have interactivity (hover effect, click moment, active control, cursor change) **+10**
9. There is a mobile version of the slider, and the placement of images, their captions, and controls is respected **+20**
10. Only relative units of measurement are used for the main blocks (images, controls, captions). Relative units: `rem, em, %, vh, vw, fr`, and etc... - the slider has "responsiveness" **+10**
11. All blocks/composite parts of the slider (controls, images, captions) are in the base flow of the DOM elements and are not positioned (position) using `top, left, right, bottom, float` is not used. Allowed: `flex, grid, margin-left`, and etc... - everything not mentioned in the prohibitions above. The position property can only be static. **+5**
12. Pseudo-elements are not used (do not confuse with pseudo-classes, pseudo-classes are allowed).**+5**

## Penalty points:

1. Using any scripts/libraries -100500
2. Using obfuscated (non-human-readable) CSS/HTML -100500
3. Cheating -100500

❗ The size of each block/font and the slider content, as well as the design, are at the developer's discretion. Deviations can vary significantly. We do not lower the score for this. The main thing is to follow the positioning/placement of blocks (images, controls, captions), and other technical requirements.

❗ The minimum page width at which the correctness of the mobile version display is checked is 500px. The desktop version is checked at the standard screen resolution of 1024px.

❗ The selection of memes is at the developer's discretion, but preferably no less than 4 pieces ;)

Good luck and success to everyone!
